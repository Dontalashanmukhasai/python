                                         PYTHON

PYTHON:    Python is a general purpose programming language which can be used for almost anything may be it can be used for web develop pages or machine learning or solving simple applications
Python is a high level interpreted language which has easy syntax and dynamic semantics
                       High level ----> python derives components from the natural language that we humans 
                                                  talk each other                                      
                       Interpreted----> the python code is compiled line by line to debugg errors to make much  
	                                     More easier.
                       dynamic semantics-->it means that we do not need to initialize anything before using it.
Features of python:
             1.simplicity: python is simple and it makes you think more before getting solution for           
	                      problem rather or without the syntax.
              2. open source: it means it is free for all to use.
              3. probability: we can write code and can share among friends or team members.
              4. Interpreted: management of memory and cpu.
5.Huge libraries: python contains huge libraries which makes you to obtain solutions to your  
                                            problem easier and with more efficiently.
Variables and datatypes:

Variables:  Its like a container to store a value in it.
   Example:    a=30
                        Name= Shannu.
Datatype: Used to define what type of variable it is.
                 The following are datatypes: 
1.	Numeric: numeric values which we are given to the variables
                  Numeric are not mutable which means we cannot change or modify the value  
                   inside the given variable.
In numeric there are three data types which are:
a)	Integers [int]
b)	Floats 
c)	Complex numbers
d)	Boolean
2.	List: lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable it may be int, float, string, complex…
3.	Tuples: tuples are similar to the list but the exception is that we cannot change the data in tupples.
4.	Dictonary: dictonaries are used to store the data in key value pairs
                              They are changeable but does not allow duplicates which means item with same key value.
The functions under dictionary are: dict.keys()
                                                                 Dict.values()
                                Dict.items()
                                 Dict.update(old,new)
Properties of python dictionary: 
•	It is unordered
•	It is mutable
•	It is indexed
•	Cannot contains duplicate keys

5.	Sets: set is a collection of unique values,it does not allow duplicates values and sets is similar to the dictionary but in sets key value does not contain.
Properties of sets :
•	Sets are unordered : elements order doesn’t matter
•	Sets are unindexed : elements cannot access by index
•	There is no way to change items in the set
•	Sets does not contains duplicate values.
              Operations in sets:
•	Len(set)
•	S.remove()
•	S.pop()
•	S.clear
•	S.union()
•	S.intersection()

6.	Strings : strings is a collection of characters in a sequence.
              String functions:  
•	Len()  : this functions returns length of the string
•	String.endswith() : this functions says whether the string is ends with the string entered by the user. If the ended string matches with user input then its gives output as True or If not gives False as output.
•	String.startswith() : this functions says whether the string is starts with the string entered by the user. If the started string matches with user input then its gives output as True or If not gives False as output.
•	String.count() : counts the occurrence of the string or characters.
•	String.captilize() : this function captilize the first character of the given string.
•	String.find(word): this functions finds the word and returns the index of the first word in the string.
•	String.replace(old  word, new word): this functions replaces the old word with the new word in the given string.


Operators :
Operators are constructs use to manipulate the data.
They are seven operators : 
1.	 arithmetic operators
2.	Assignment operators
3.	Comparison operators 
4.	Logical operators
5.	Bitwise operators
6.	Identity operators
7.	Membership operators

Conditional satetments:
                                           Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
•	Equals: a == b
•	Not Equals: a != b
•	Less than: a < b
•	Less than or equal to: a <= b
•	Greater than: a > b
•	Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
Elif:
The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

Else:
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
Loops in python:
Sometimes we need to repeat the set of statements in our programs for instance.
Loops make it easy to the programmer to the computer for which of instructions should repeat.
Types of Loops:
•	While loop: In while loop the condition is checked first, if it is true the body of the  loop is executed ortherwise it will not.
If it enters in to loop, the loop get executed until the condition becomes false.
•	For loop: for loop is used to iterate through a sequence like list, tupples or string.

 Functions and Recursions:
Functions: 
                        A function is a group of statements to perform single task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again.
Syntax: def my_function():
 
Types of Functions in python: 
•	 Builtin function: already present in python
•	User defined function: user have to define.

Recursion: Recursion is a function which call itself. It is used to use the mathematical functions directly as function.
Syntax :         def function():
                                                 .
                                                 .
                                                 .
                        Function()
